# Getting help with the cluster

If you are having problems with using the cluster or running the software or workflows you need we can help you to get things working again.  You've already started well by finding the cluster documentation!  If you think there are areas where this could be improved then please contact us.

## Video tutorials
In addition to the written cluster documentation we also have [video tutorials](https://vimeo.com/user/132030108/folder/21518400) for some of the main features of the cluster which may be useful.

## Help contacts

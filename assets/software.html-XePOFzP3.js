Many packages will now recommend this method for installing software, and it can be very convenient when it works (but also quite a pain if it fails!).</p><p>Historically people tended to use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conda</a> package manager, but due to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/08/anaconda_puts_the_squeeze_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal problems associated with the use of this software</a> the use of conda on the cluster is <strong>not permitted</strong>. The software itself is open source and not problematic, but the default configuration uses repositories which require a paid license.

Direct access is <em>not</em> available from any of the following:</p><ul><li>A non Babraham-instistute machine, even if connected to Eduroam at Babraham</li><li>A Babraham institute machine connected to Eduroam on another site (ie at the university)</li><li>A Babraham institute machine connected to the cloud wireless network</li></ul><h3 id="off-site-access" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#off-site-access"><span>Off site access</span></a></h3><p>You can connect to the cluster from outside the institute in one of the following ways</p><ul><li>By using the Babraham VPN service on an institute laptop</li><li>By using the RDWeb service from any machine (once you have registered for RDWeb access)</li><li>By using a network which has been specifically permitted to access the cluster (mostly for campus companies)</li></ul><h2 id="software-required-to-use-the-cluster" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#software-required-to-use-the-cluster"><span>Software required to use the cluster</span></a></h2><p>There are two ways you can connect to the cluster</p><ol><li>A command line SSH connection. This is the most direct and flexible way to use the cluster. It gives you command line access to the head node and lets you run linux commands directly.</li><li>A connection to the cluster web interface. The cluster web interface can be used to monitor your cluster use, and also to run certain types of application such as Rstudio sessions or Jupyter labs notebooks. Use of the web interface only requires a web browser.</li></ol><p>The software you&#39;ll need to connect to the cluster varies depending on what operating system you&#39;re using.</p><h3 id="windows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#windows"><span>Windows</span></a></h3><p>Windows users will need to install two pieces of software to access the cluster. To allow a command line connection they should use PuTTY. For running graphical programs you will need an additional piece of software called VcXsrv Windows X Server.

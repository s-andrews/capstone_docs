The power of the cluster comes from the number of CPUs and amount of memory it has.</p><p>The system is currently an 880 node linux cluster. It has around 2 Petabytes of attached storage. It has a wide variety of common bioinformatics packages installed and should provide a powerful platform for all manner of large scale computational analyses.</p><p>The servers in the cluster are split into compute nodes and a head nodes. When using the cluster you only normally directly interact with the head node and it can communicate with the processing nodes to actually carry out the work you request.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-cluster-good-for" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-cluster-good-for"><span>What is the cluster good for?</span></a></h2><p>The cluster can be brilliant for computational problems which satisfy any of of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>They require a lot of CPU power, and the processing can be split across multiple CPUs</li><li>The require a large amount of memory (RAM).
